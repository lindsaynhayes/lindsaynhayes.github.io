I evaluated an\nenvironmental risk factor (developmental inflammation) in disease\npathophysiology using the maternal immune activation (MIA) mouse model\n(Hayes et al. 2021; Mueller et al.\n2019). After prenatal inflammation, I found a baseline\nincrease stress hormones in the periphery, and an altered protein\noxidative stress in the brain consistent with observations from clinical\nstudies (Fukudome et al.\n2018). Furthermore, I found a blunted microglia reactivity,\nparticularly in the striatum, after MIA, along with electrophysiological\nabnormalities in corticostriatal circuits (Hayes et al. 2021). The MIA microglia\nshowed epigenetic changes and impaired transcriptional regulation in\nresponse to prenatal immune stress as a mechanism for the blunted\nreactivity (Hayes et al.\n2021). Finally, I determined the dysfunctional microglia were\ncausal to the proper development of the corticostriatal circuits (Hayes et al. 2021). In summary, I\ndetermined that prenatal immune stress acts as a tolerizing stimulus on\nmicroglia leading to a long-term functional impairment and contribution\nto development of impaired neural circuits in the basal ganglia.\nData Analysis for Hayes et\nal.2022\nsingle cell RNA-seq of mouse microglia\nfrom the striatum after LPS treatmentClinical Inflammation\n& Oxidative Stress\nThe role of inflammation and oxidative stress in psychiatric\ndisorders remains controversial. Previous data is confounded by extended\nexposure to medication, duration of illness, and lack of a clear\ncellular mechanism. In these translational psychiatry studies, we\nobtained cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood from drug-naïve,\nrecent-onset, and chronic psychosis patients. We found increased\ninflammatory markers (Hayes et al. 2014; Tanaka et al. 2017) and altered\noxidative stress pathways (Coughlin et al.\n2016, 2017;\nNucifora et al.\n2017) in schizophrenia and psychosis patients at the early\nstages of disease without the influence of extended medication. We\nobserved increased levels of antibodies for infectious agents in\npsychosis patients, and many of the inflammatory markers were correlated\nwith the antibodies for infectious agents (Hayes et al. 2014). Furthermore,\ncognitive function was found to correlate with one of the infectious\nagents (Hayes et al.\n2014). These data suggest that exposure to infection agents\nmay contribute to altered immune function in patients with psychotic\ndisorders and impair cognitive function. Together these translational\npsychiatry studies provide further evidence for a neuroimmunological\nmechanism in the pathology of psychiatric disorders.\nAnalytes measured in CSF from SZ and ARMS\nparticipantsDevelopmental Biology\nProjects\nThrough a number of projects we determined how diversification of\ncellular identity is specified from a defined progenitor domain through\nclose temporal and spatial control of progenitor cells. Deciphering cell\nfate specification is important for cell-based therapeutics targeting\ncell replacement and discovering how cells become susceptible in\ndisease. Using combinatorial genetic fate mapping approaches, these\nstudies defined how progenitors become specified before differentiation\nbased on the spatial and temporal expression of key developmental genes\n(Shh, Gli1, Nkx2.1, and Wnt1)(Hayes et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2011; Carney et al.\n2010). Furthermore, we were the first to demonstrate that\ncessation of Shh signaling after the critical period is important for\nmidbrain patterning(Hayes et al.\n2013). In sum, we found that spatial location within the\nprogenitor domain, timing of gene expression, and duration of downstream\nsignaling are all critical for proper differentiation and subtype\nspecification. These findings can provide a guide map for generation of\nspecific cell types in vitro for cell replacement in neurodegenerative\ndiseases.\nHayes et al. 2011 Fate Mapping of Shh and\nGli1 progenitors in the mouse ventral mesencephalonSite\nCreated with Blogdown, Distill, and postscards\n\n\n\nBrown, Ashly, Jason T Machan, Lindsay Hayes, and Mark Zervas. 2011.\n“Molecular Organization and Timing of Wnt1 Expression Define\nCohorts of Midbrain Dopamine Neuron Progenitors in Vivo.” J.\nComp.
