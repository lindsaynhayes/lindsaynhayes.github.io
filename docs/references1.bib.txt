  abstract  = "Many types of stressors have an impact on brain development,
               function, and disease susceptibility including immune stressors,
               psychosocial stressors, and exposure to drugs of abuse. We
               propose that these diverse developmental stressors may utilize a
               common mechanism that underlies impaired cognitive function and
               neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and
               mood disorders that can develop in later life as a result of
               developmental stressors. While these stressors are directed at
               critical developmental windows, their impacts are long-lasting.
               Immune activation is a shared pathophysiology across several
               different developmental stressors and may thus be a targetable
               treatment to mitigate the later behavioral deficits. In this
               review, we explore different types of prenatal and perinatal
               stressors and their contribution to disease risk and underlying
               molecular mechanisms. We highlight the impact of developmental
               stressors on microglia biology because of their early
               infiltration into the brain, their critical role in brain
               development and function, and their long-lived status in the
               brain throughout life. Furthermore, we introduce innate immune
               memory as a potential underlying mechanism for developmental
               stressors' impact on disease. Finally, we highlight the
               molecular and epigenetic reprogramming that is known to underlie
               innate immune memory and explain how similar molecular
               mechanisms may be at work for cells to retain a long-term
               perturbation after exposure to developmental stressors.",

               controlling various poly(I:C) products for potential
               contamination with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found
               significant variability between different batches of poly(I:C)
               potassium salt obtained from the same vendor (Sigma-Aldrich) in
               terms of the relative amount of dsRNA fragments in the high
               molecular weight range (1000-6000 nucleotides long) and with
               regards to their effects on maternal thermoregulation and immune
               responses in maternal plasma, placenta and fetal brain. Batches
               of poly(I:C) potassium salt containing larger amounts of high
               molecular weight fragments induced more extensive effects on
               thermoregulation and immune responses compared to batches with
               minimal amounts of high molecular weight fragments. Consistent
               with these findings, poly(I:C) enriched for high molecular
               weight dsRNA (HMW) caused larger maternal and placental immune
               responses compared to low molecular weight (LMW) poly(I:C).
               These variable effects were unrelated to possible LPS
               contamination. Finally, we found marked variability between
               different batches of the poly(I:C) potassium salt in terms of
               their effects on spontaneous abortion rates. This batch-to-batch
               variability was confirmed by three independent research groups

               study population (P<0.001) and in patients with recent onset of
               schizophrenia alone (P=0.03). Our results suggest that increased
               levels of IL-6 may occur in the absence of changed TSPO PET
               signal in the brains of medicated patients with recent onset of

               targeting alternative markers of glial activation and immune
               response may be needed to capture the inflammatory signature
               present in the brains of patients with early-stage disease.",

               at risk mental status for psychosis (ARMS), in comparison with
               healthy controls (HCs). We measured 90 analytes using a broad
               multiplex platform focusing on immune and inflammatory cascades
               then selected 35 with our quality reporting criteria for further
               analysis. We also examined Toxoplasma gondii (TG) and herpes
               simplex virus 1 antibody levels in CSF. We report that
               expression of 15 molecules was significantly altered in the
               patient groups (SZ and ARMS) compared with HCs. The majority of
               these molecular changes (alpha-2-macroglobulin [$\alpha$2M],
               fibrinogen, interleukin-6 receptor [IL-6R], stem cell factor

               be good candidates for predictive markers for psychosis from an
               early stage. Lastly, reduction of IL-6R, TGF$\alpha$, and ACE

              the timing of Shh and its response gene Gli1 segregates mDA
              neurons, their overall lineage contribution to mDA neurons
              heavily overlaps. Here, we demonstrate that the same set of mDA

              expression), induce Shh expression, and then turn off Shh
              responsiveness. Thus, at any given developmental stage, cells
              rarely co-express Shh and Gli1. Using Shh(Cre:GFP) mice to delete
              the Smoothened receptor in the Shh pathway, we demonstrate that

              the vMb primordia delineated their spatial contribution to the

               and modulate complex functions through precisely organized
               anatomical groups. MbDA neurons are generated from
               Wnt1-expressing progenitors located in the ventral mesencephalon
               (vMes) during embryogenesis. However, it is unclear whether the
               progenitor pool is partitioned into distinct cohorts based on
               molecular identity and whether the timing of gene expression
               uniquely identifies subtypes of MbDA neurons. In this study we
               show that Wnt1-expressing MbDA progenitors from embryonic day
               (E)8.5-12.5 have dynamic molecular identities that correlate
               with specific spatial locations in the vMes. We also tested the
               hypothesis that the timing of Wnt1 expression in progenitors is
               related to the distribution of anatomically distinct cohorts of
               adult MbDA neurons using genetic inducible fate mapping (GIFM).
               We demonstrate that the Wnt1 lineage contributes to specific
               cohorts of MbDA neurons during a 7-day epoch and that the
               contribution to MbDA neurons predominates over other ventral Mb
               domains. In addition, we show that calbindin-, GIRK2-, and
               calretinin-expressing MbDA neuron subtypes are derived from
               Wnt1-expressing progenitors marked over a broad temporal window.
               Through GIFM and quantitative analysis we demonstrate that the
               Wnt1 lineage does not undergo progressive lineage restriction,
               which eliminates a restricted competence model of generating
               MbDA diversity. Interestingly, we uncover that two significant
               peaks of Wnt1 lineage contribution to MbDA neurons occur at E9.5
               and E11.5. Collectively, our findings delineate the temporal
               window of MbDA neuron generation and show that lineage and

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The mammalian amygdala is composed of two primary
               functional subdivisions, classified according to whether the
               major output projection of each nucleus is excitatory or
               inhibitory. The posterior dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the
               medial amygdala, which primarily contain inhibitory output
               neurons, modulate specific aspects of innate socio-sexual and
               aggressive behaviors. However, the development of the neuronal
               diversity of this complex and important structure remains to be
               fully elucidated. RESULTS: Using a combination of genetic
               fate-mapping and loss-of-function analyses, we examined the
               contribution and function of Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-expressing and
               Shh-responsive (Nkx2-1+ and Gli1+) neurons in the medial
               amygdala. Specifically, we found that Shh- and Nkx2-1-lineage
               cells contribute differentially to the dorsal and ventral
               subdivisions of the postnatal medial amygdala. These Shh- and
               Nkx2-1-lineage neurons express overlapping and non-overlapping
               inhibitory neuronal markers, such as Calbindin, FoxP2, nNOS and
               Somatostatin, revealing diverse fate contributions in discrete
               medial amygdala nuclear subdivisions. Electrophysiological
               analysis of the Shh-derived neurons additionally reveals an
               important functional diversity within this lineage in the medial
               amygdala. Moreover, inducible Gli1CreER(T2) temporal fate
               mapping shows that early-generated progenitors that respond to
               Shh signaling also contribute to medial amygdala neuronal
               diversity. Lastly, analysis of Nkx2-1 mutant mice demonstrates a
               genetic requirement for Nkx2-1 in inhibitory neuronal
               specification in the medial amygdala distinct from the
               requirement for Nkx2-1 in cerebral cortical development.
               CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data reveal a differential
               contribution of Shh-expressing and Shh-responding cells to
               medial amygdala neuronal diversity as well as the function of
               Nkx2-1 in the development of this important limbic system
